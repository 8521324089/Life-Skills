# FireWalls

## Abstract
A firewall is a critical component in network security, acting as a barrier between trusted internal systems and untrusted external networks. 
This paper presents a technical study on firewalls, including their types, functions, advantages, and limitations. 
The work explores real-world applications across industries and discusses future trends such as AI-driven firewalls and cloud-based security. 

## Introduction
With the increasing reliance on digital technologies, cyber threats have grown more sophisticated, targeting both individuals and organisations. 
Data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorised access have become common security challenges. 
A firewall serves as a protective mechanism by monitoring, filtering, and controlling network traffic according to predefined security rules. 

## RelatedWork
Numerous studies have highlighted the role of firewalls in cybersecurity. 
Traditional packet-filtering firewalls were among the earliest security solutions, but were limited in handling complex threats. 
Stateful inspection and proxy firewalls offered enhanced security by analysing connection states and application traffic. 

## Methodology
This study is based on a review of existing firewall technologies and their implementations in various environments. 
Data was gathered from academic literature, industry whitepapers, and practical case studies of firewall deployments. 
The research focuses on categorising firewalls, identifying their key functions, and analysing their impact on network security.

## Firewall Technologies and Classification
### Deployment-Based Classification
#### Hardware Firewalls:
Standalone physical devices used at network perimeters.
#### Software Firewalls: 
Installed on individual systems for endpoint protection.
### Functionality-Based Classification
#### Packet-Filtering Firewalls: 
Rule-based inspection of IP packets.
#### Stateful Inspection Firewalls: 
Track connection states to improve security.

## Results
The study highlights that traditional firewalls, while still in use, are inadequate for countering advanced threats such as polymorphic malware 
and encrypted attacks, so we have to update them regularly.

## Conclusion
Firewalls remain an essential defence mechanism in the cybersecurity domain. They provide robust protection against unauthorised access 
and malicious traffic, serving as the first line of defence in network infrastructure.
