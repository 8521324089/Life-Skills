# Good Practices for Software Development

## Which point(s) were new to you?
#### The point(s) were new to us are-
- Sometimes despite all efforts, the requirements are still vague. So during the implementation phase, get frequent feedback so that you are on track and everyone is on the same page.
- Look at the way issues get reported in large open-source projects.
- Try to find out relevant team member's work schedules, and set up a call when they are free.
- Be available when someone replies to your message. Things move faster if it's a real-time conversation as compared to a back and forth every hour.
- We should strongly consider blocking social media sites and apps during work hours. Tools like TimeLimit, Freedom, or any other app can be helpful.
- We recommend tracking your time using app like Boosted to improve productivity.

#### The area for progress are-
