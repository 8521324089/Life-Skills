# Tiny Habits

## 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
#### The concept that stood out most is starting with ridiculously tiny habits—like flossing just one tooth or doing two push-ups—and building from there. This radical simplicity flips the usual habit-change narrative:
- Tiny habits are easy—so you’re more likely to do them, even when motivation is low.
- The Fogg Behaviour Model (B = MAP) explains it concisely: Behaviour occurs when Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt converge at the same moment.

## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A and P?
#### Behaviour (B) happens only when all three elements converge:  
- M = Motivation.
- A = Ability.
- P = Prompt (cue or trigger).
* At any moment, if a behaviour doesn’t occur, it means one or more of these is missing. The model also shows that Motivation and Ability compensate for each other—higher ability makes a behaviour easier even when motivation is low, and vice versa.

## 3. Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit. 
#### Habits are formed by emotion, not willpower
- We often think repetition alone forms habits, but brain science shows positive emotions wire new behaviours into memory faster than logic or discipline.
- When you celebrate, your brain releases dopamine, reinforcing the connection between the action and a good feeling.  

#### Immediate reinforcement strengthens learning
- The brain learns best when reward comes right after the behaviour.
- If you celebrate instantly (even with a smile, fist pump, or saying “Yes!”), Your brain tags that action as important and makes you want to repeat it.

#### Builds intrinsic motivation
- Celebration transforms a tiny action (like flossing one tooth) from a chore into a victory.
- Over time, you don’t do it because you “should”—you do it because it feels good.

#### Compound Growth in Practice: Improving just 1% every day leads to being 37x better by year’s end—or nearly zero if getting 1% worse instead 
* Systems Over Goals: It’s not about radical change; it’s about building a system of tiny, repeatable actions that shape outcomes and identity.
* Four-Stage Habit Framework:
- Noticing: become aware of opportunities.
- Wanting: align the environment to make good habits easier.
- Doing: prioritise repetition over perfection.
- Liking: embed immediate enjoyment or reward to reinforce behaviour.

## 5. What is the book's perspective on Identity?  
#### James Clear argues that lasting behaviour change depends on shifting your identity, not just setting goals. This is the "identity-based habits" perspective, and it’s one of the most powerful ideas in the book.

## 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do. 
#### James Clear explains that to build good habits consistently, you must reduce friction and make the habit so easy that it feels natural to do. This idea comes from the Laws of Behaviour Change, specifically the 3rd Law: Make it Easy.
- Focus on Action, Not Motivation
- The Two-Minute Rule 
- Reduce Friction for Good Habits

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do. 
#### Atomic Habits doesn’t just teach how to build good habits; it also explains how to break bad ones by making them harder to do. This is the opposite of the “Make it Easy” law.
- Increase Friction for Bad Habits.
- Use Commitment Devices.
- Make It Unattractive or Inconvenient.

## 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive, or easy and or response satisfying? 
#### Habit I’d Like to Do More Of: Daily Reading

## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard, or the response unsatisfying?
